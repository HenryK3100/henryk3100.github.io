    "text": "Welcome\nHello! This is my simple personal website.\n\n\n\nMy name is Henry Kombol and I am an Applied Economics Master’s Student at the University of Minnesota. I started my academic journey at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California, obtaining a B.S. in Economics in 2022. Upon graduation, I became the inagural Pre-Doctoral Fellow at the Center for the Study of Los Angeles. StudyLA advocates for a better more equitable Los Angeles through research, student mentorship, and engagement with residents and leaders. After two years at StudyLA, I moved to Minneapolis Minnesota and worked at the Animal Humane Society as a Advancement Data Analyst before I started at the University of Minnesota in Fall 2025. My research interests revolve around Developmental and Environmental Economics. I have experience in R, Stata, Python, SAS, and Excel."
